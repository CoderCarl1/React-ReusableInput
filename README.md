## Re-usable form component

This is a demonstration of a re-usable component

DropDown.js takes props:

 - The handleChange function
 - title for the select
 - Options
 - Name of Label1

 By creating a separate Business Logic file we can re-use the DropDown.js component any time we want.

 ### Other ways to make this re-usable
 
 - We can pass down styling in the props of the component.
 More information & examples on creating re-usable components can be read in [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-reusable-ui-components-with-react-hooks/#:~:text=For%20a%20component%20to%20be,to%20ensure%20they%20work%20correctly.)
